<h1>Remote meetings with many participants in one location</h1>

<h2>What to do</h2>
In teams where most team members are in one location, I ask for everybody to do the call from their own computer. This way the playing field is leveled and the “remote” team members can participate equally. If the team refuses this, then you need to ensure that all the active speakers and decision maker leave the team room, and participate from their own computers. 

<h2>Why</h2>
Unlike at a table meeting, you can have more conversations going on around the table like at a party or dinner table. If you want to share information this is not very useful and once these second conversations starts focus is lost. 

You cannot have a second conversation going on in a phone call with the same number of people as at the table. Phone calls and a face to face talks are different and works very differently. If two people are having an argument and a third listens in via a phone, she will have a hard time to grasp what is going on. If they are all on the phone, the listener will easily pick up what is going on. 

The problem is, that putting two people in one location and the third in another location, they two first people tend to forget that they need to behave as if they having a phone call together. The more of a team that is in the same location, and the more key and senior people are in the same room, the less they concern themselves with the phone call they are engaged in and the more lost and uninteresting the phone call becomes for those actually being on the call.
